I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [Statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu){:target="_blank"} at the University of Chicago. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Victor Veitch](http://victorveitch.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I graduated from [Seoul National University](https://stat.snu.ac.kr/en/){:target="_blank"}, majoring in Statistics and Mathematics. At SNU, I worked with Prof. [Sungkyu Jung](http://jung.snu.ac.kr){:target="_blank"}.
